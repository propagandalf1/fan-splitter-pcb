# Fan-Splitter-PCB
A PCB designed to connect multiple 4 Pin PWM Fans without cable splitters.

## current

* ordered prototype 

## To Do

* confirm working prototype
* adding 2 way splitter
* adding 4 way splitter
* maybe Watercool MO-RA Version?

## Version 0.2

I added 2 more connectors so now the splitter supports 140 AND 120mm fans within a single pcb. So you only have to order one batch to connect a 420 and a 360 radiator instead of ordering 2 seperate batches and different pcbs as intended in the first place.

## Version 0.1

Currently it only supports 360 radiators or 3x120mm fan configurations.
More will come in the future. Also feel free to adopt this idea to your own needs.
